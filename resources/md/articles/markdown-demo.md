# How to write markdown content

>This is a quote. The right pointing arrow indicates a quote.

This is an example of a webpage link: [Clojure](https://clojure.org/).

Write your paragraph here with more content. If you wish to separate paragraphs, make sure you keep one line gap between the two paragraphs.

## This is second level heading

If you wish to make a list, make sure to start the list after a gap of one line before a paragraph, like below:

- Data
- Function

### This is 3rd level heading
- If you are starting a list just after a heading, one-line gap is not required
- For example, this list

This is `an inline code representation`. It comes handy when annotating code related aspects.

**This is a blod text.**

The following is a code block sample (you may annotate the language name with backquotes):

```clojure
{:name "Alex"
 :age 30
 :bald? false}
```

The following is how you insert an image:

![alt text](img/logo.png "My logo")
